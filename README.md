Welcome to my APF simulation, you're probably visiting from the SPIE 2025 Optics + Photonics Conference.

Below, you'll be able to see a simulated correction done in closed loop operation. This were done in seeing = 1.5" 
conditions with multiple layers of atmosphere. It uses a mag 0.0 guidestar and a 16x16-subaperture SHWFS.

There is a little unexpected saturation along the edges of the DM during the correction, that is something I hope to explore and fix in the future.
